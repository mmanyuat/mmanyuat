# 👋 Hi, I’m @mmanyuat!

Welcome to my corner of the internet! I’m a curious, teachable, and enthusiastic software engineer who loves to blend philosophy, technology, 
and African culture into unique and meaningful projects. Here's a bit about me:

- 👀 **I’m interested in:**  
  Exploring how technology can be used to solve real-world problems, particularly in healthcare, education,
  and self-growth in Africa. I'm also fascinated by AI, web development, and creating impactful digital experiences.

- 🌱 **I’m currently learning:**  
  Everything I can! Right now, I’m deep-diving into advanced topics in software engineering through the ALX program,
  with a focus on backend development (Python/Flask), databases (MySQL), and system design. I’m also experimenting with AI tools to push the boundaries of innovation.

- 💞️ **I’m looking to collaborate on:**  
  Projects that make the world a better place! Whether it's a healthcare app (like my current project DocBridge),
  a tech-for-good initiative, or anything that leverages tech to empower others, I’m in. Let’s build something awesome together!

- 📫 **How to reach me:**  
  You can connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mmanyuat) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/mmanyuat), or shoot me an email at mmanyuat@201.com.

- ⚡ **Fun fact:**  
  I’m a huge fan of chess and anime! I love challenging myself to a good chess game and diving into the deep,
  immersive worlds of anime during my downtime. If you ever want to chat about your favorite openings or anime recommendations, hit me up!

Thanks for stopping by! Let’s innovate, collaborate, and create something impactful together. 🚀
